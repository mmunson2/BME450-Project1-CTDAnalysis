## Description And Problem Statement:
This project tasked students with accessing data collected from various profilers off the Oregon Coast.  
Temperature, salinity, and depth readings were used to calculate the speed of sound in the water. This
date was plotted as speed of sound versus depth to illustrate how the aformentioned parameters vary.  
  
The number of dives made by the profiler was calculated and included in the results section. The  
beginning and end of each dive was also recorded and used to plot the speed of sound for individual
dives. A typical dive profile appears as shown:
