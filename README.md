## Description And Problem Statement:
This project tasked students with accessing data collected from various profilers off the Oregon Coast.  
Temperature, salinity, and depth readings were used to calculate the speed of sound in the water. This
date was plotted as speed of sound versus depth to illustrate how the aformentioned parameters vary.  
  
The number of dives made by the profiler was calculated and included in the results section. The  
beginning and end of each dive was also recorded and used to plot the speed of sound for individual
dives. A typical dive profile appears as shown:

## Oregon Offshore Cabled Deep Profiler Mooring - Winter
The dive number for this test is likely skewed as the profiler wasn't operating all day.  
Data was very limited from this source  
Number of Dives:  2

# Questions:  

### Compare the number of dives per day of the shallow profiler vs deep profiler:  


### Where is the maximum value of sspin each season? Explain why the max ssp should be there?  


### Compare the ssp profile in day and nightof all profilers, explain what you find(effect of day vs night).  


### Compare the ssp profile in summer and winterof all profilers, explain what you find(effect of season).  


### Compare the average ssp profiles of all profilers recorded at the same day inwinter and summer (effect of location).
